# install-hooks.sh — one-time bootstrap for git hooks
#
# Usage:  bash install-hooks.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Tells git to look for hooks in .githooks/ instead of .git/hooks/
#   2. Marks all hooks in .githooks/ as executable
#   3. Verifies the setup by listing the active hook path
#
# Why .githooks/ instead of .git/hooks/?
#   - .githooks/ is versioned with the repo, so hooks are shared across clones
#   - .git/hooks/ is local-only and not committed
#
# Why not Husky/lefthook?
#   - Our hooks are pure bash + node, no npm dependency needed
#   - Keeps the toolchain minimal (no package.json required to enable hooks)
#
# Active hooks (as of 2026-06-25):
#   - pre-commit  : 5-phase checks:
#                   Phase 0: worklog freshness (RULE-MONOLITH-002, WARN)
#                   Phase 1: verify-standards.js V01-V11 (HARD BLOCK)
#                   Phase 2: verify-id-graph.js G01-G15 (HARD BLOCK)
#                   Phase 3: verify-skills.js --strict (HARD BLOCK)
#                   Phase 4: PROC-COCHANGE-003 (RULE-MONOLITH-010, SOFT WARN)
#                   Phase 5: PROC-LINECOUNT-004 (RULE-MONOLITH-012, SOFT WARN)
#                   See skills/skills/commit-work/CONTRACT.md §3-4.
#   - commit-msg  : Conventional Commits format validation on commit
#                   message (RULE-MONOLITH-004). Added in O-017 Phase B2.

#   skills/skills/commit-work/scripts/run-contract.sh — callable runtime
